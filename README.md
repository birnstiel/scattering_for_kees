# Scattering slab

solves the scattering slab analytical solution (2-stream, with/without Eddington-Barbier approximation) and for comparison sets up and runs a RADMC3D plane-parallel setup.

Run the notebook to compare the solutions.

## Requirements: 

- RADMC3D on the path
- `disklab`
- `astropy`
- `radmc3dPy` (to read the image pixel, can probably easily be replaced)
